Ku Setup Kit:
  The broadband service on the Ku band is provided on the iDirect platform.

VSAT parameters include:
  Antenna sizes: 1.2m, 1.8m, 2.4m,
  LNB: iDirect / Universal with LO of 11300MHz,
  BUC: 3Watt iDirect or equivalent,
  Polarization: Linear,
  Satellite location: 42.5oE,
  Bandwidth: Dedicated/Shared,
  Frequency: 14/12Ghz.

Advantages of Ku:
  Allows for smaller dishes for VSAT Application,
  Higher satellite transponder power is conditionally available,
  Lesser terrestrial interference

Ka Broadband services:
  The product is known as “NigKaNet”.Ka-Band provides satellite broadband solutions with coverage over Nigeria through “NEWTEC DIALOG HUB”. NigComSat Ka-band is efficient because of its high EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power) over the satellite footprints. It is based on the transmitter power and the antenna gain which indicates the total power that would be needed for an isotropic antenna if it were to produce the same power density as a beam antenna. 

Ka Set-Up Kit:
  Indoor unit : IP Satellite Modem,
  Outdoor unit: Antenna, Low Noise Block signal receiver(LNB), Multiplier Up Converter signal transmitter(MUC) or Block Up, Converter(BUC) signal transmitter.

Ka Bandwidth packages:
  2mbps/512kbps (30GB),
  5mbps/768kbps (70GB),
  6mbps/1.5mbps (150GB),
  12mbps/3mbps (300GB),
  24mbps/6mbps (600GB),


Advantages of Ka:
  More content and services,
  Small and large networks,
  Fast roll out and easy use,
  Complete modem portfolio,

C Broadband Services:
  C Broadband service is provided on standard C-band and over AMOS 17 satellite located at 17oE with footprints over West, East and Southern Africa. This band is not susceptible to rain.


C Setup Kit:
  Antenna sizes: 1.8m, 2.4m 
  LNB:  iDirect /Universal with LO of 5150MHz 
  BUC:  5Watt with LO of 4900MHz  
  Polarization: Circular 
  Satellite location: 17oE 
  Bandwidth: Dedicated/Shared 
  Frequency: 6/4Ghz 
  Look angle for Lagos : Elevation – 72.5o,  Azimuth – 115.06o 


Advantages of C:
  Lower Frequency that is not affected by the weather conditions including rain
  Cheaper bandwidth
